# Handwritten Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Prototype
### Introduction
This project aims to prototype a system for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on handwritten characters. The goal is to develop a proof of concept using the MNIST database of handwritten digits. Although the final system will be designed for recognizing custom handwritten characters, the MNIST dataset serves as a starting point due to its similarities in input and output.

### MNIST Dataset
The MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits (0 to 9) and is widely used as a benchmark for evaluating machine learning algorithms. Each image is a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels. The dataset includes a training set, a validation set, and a test set.
